# 2D Platformer Game Kit
A Unity Project

UPDATE: Requires Unity version 2021.3.6f1

This is a starter project and kit created for teaching forward game design (follow the fun) and principles of interactivity to students in the Arts and Entertainment Technologies program at the University of Texas in Austin. Based on a tight and smooth 2D platformer, this project features:
- High frequency physics for solid and responsive game feel
- Well balanced character controller for tight control and great platforming action
- Realtime physics objects (for puzzles and challenges)
- A trigger system that detects the player or other objects to support:
  - growing/shrinking objects
  - showing/hiding objects
  - activating/deactivating rigidbodies
  - coloring objects
  - playing/changing music and sound FX
  - dynamic camera zoom control]
  - post processing effects
  - ending a level
- A basic game manager with modes and input filtering (for simple title/game over screen)
- Works with all collider types (sprite, primitive, tilemap, spriteshape)
