Unity 2D Platformer Project

This is a starter project for teaching forward game design (follow the fun) and principles of interactivity to students in the Arts and Entertainment Technologies program at the University of Texas in Austin. Based on a tight and smooth 2D platformer, this project features realtime physics objects, sound support and a trigger system for dynamically growing/shrinking/showing/hiding/coloring objects.
