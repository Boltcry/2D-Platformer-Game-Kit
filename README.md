Unity 2D Platformer Project

This is a starter project for teaching forward game design and principles of interactivity to students in the Arts and Entertainment Technologies program at the University of Texas in Austin. Based on a tight and smooth 2D platformer, this project also features realtime physics objects, sound support and a trigger system for growing/shrinking/showing/hiding/coloring objects.
