# 2D Platformer Game Kit
A Unity Project

This is a starter project and kit created for teaching forward game design (follow the fun) and principles of interactivity to students in the Arts and Entertainment Technologies program at the University of Texas in Austin. Based on a tight and smooth 2D platformer, this project features:
- realtime physics objects (for puzzles and challenges)
- a trigger system for dynamically growing/shrinking/showing/hiding/coloring objects, playing/changing music and sound FX, camera zoom control, and post processing effects.
